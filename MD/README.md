## Note üìù

If you have error about gradle location when runing this program, you can **JUST DELETE ALL FILE IN .idea FOLDER** cause actualy .idea folder is not supposed to push on github and by default it will blocked by .gitignore, but because yah... we are to ~~lazy~~ busy to delete or create .gitignore file in main entry so it's like thisüòÖ

- So basicly you jus have to **clone the code**

```bash
git clone https://github.com/raffiMRG/C242-PS362_diabetes_risk_prediction.git
```

- go to C242-PS362_diabetes_risk_prediction/MD

- delete **.idea** & run using android studio

- Done
